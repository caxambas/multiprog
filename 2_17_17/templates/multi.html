<div style='color:blue'>This website computes and gives prognosis data comparing the Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP along with the PaP-Delirium), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI), Performance Status-Based Palliative Prognostic Index (PS-PPI), Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and ECOG status which have been validated in patients with advanced cancer.<br><br>
Please enter as many variables as possible, and this prognostic calculator will provide survival data based on published studies. Please keep in mind these outputs represent survival estimates only â€“ it is important to use clinical judgement to interpret the results accordingly.</div><br>

For convenience, here is a <a href="{{ url_for('reference') }}">reference to look up the PPS, KPS, and ECOG of a patient.</a><br><br>

<b>Notes</b><br>
1: In the PPI, oral intake is considered normal if a patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for a bowel obstruction.
<br>
2: In the PPI dyspnea was positive if it was at present at rest. For the PaP & D-PaP, it was positive if it was present at the time of scoring, which for this calculator is assumed to be at rest as well.
<br>
3: In the PPI delirium is counted as absent if it is due to a single medication. The D-PaP study makes no such allowance for medication induced delirium, hence there are three options.
<br>
4: This is the <i>clinical symptom</i> of anorexia (ie, lack of appetite), not to be confused with cachexia or weight loss.<br>
5: In the PaP and D-PaP, only solid tumors were included.  Therefore the WBC and lymphocyte inputs do not include options for neutropenia or lymphocytosis.
