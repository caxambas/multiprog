To Discuss with Dr. Hui:

Additions he should see:
    -Addition to reference about interconversion between scoring (Ma paper)
    -Addition to PPS/KPS dif 30% and ECOG validations
    -So there is a little bit of inconsistency in how strict we are, but it allows leeway so I would prefer not shutting people out
    
    -Addition of links that pop up if there is a prediction of days
    -Should we include both pre/post-test and model?
    -How should I name them?

Probabilities
    -PS-PPI issue with score <=3.5
    -Baba PPI, PaP, D-PaP for score 4-6 (have two bounds)
        -currently not reported
    -Morita didn't give prob for ppi < 4, I just inverted the data
    
Should we add additional information or links up front about each model (such as another reference page that gives a simple overview of each model and how it works?)

Disclaimer ok?

Emails

"Start Screen" (should we have this vs have user land on the Multiple calculator)
    -I think focus should be on the multiple model, with link at bottom to other ones and the suggestion as made

10 days vs 14 days?
